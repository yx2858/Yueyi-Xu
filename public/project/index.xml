      <description>Introduction The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in China in December 2019. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant public health threat, particularly affecting older adults and individuals with chronic health conditions. Factors such as age, gender, vaccination status, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, and pre-existing chronic illnesses play a crucial role in determining the recovery time for patients1.&#xA;In this project, we fit various models based on factors that potentially affect COVID-19 recovery time.</description>

      <description>logistic Regression clean data Abstract Abstract. This study evaluates the predictive performance of four methods—logistic regression, survival analysis, decision tree, and random forest—in determining the status of breast cancer patients. The results indicate that random forest exhibits the highest prediction accuracy, reaching 89.59%. Additionally, although variations in accuracy exist among the models, there are minimal differences in accuracy within each model when predicting outcomes for both white and black individuals.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort. Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.” — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1&#xA;Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description>
